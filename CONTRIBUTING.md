## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20 or later)
- **Nx CLI** (if not installed globally, you can use `npx nx`)
- **Python** (3.12 or later)
    - **Poetry** (2.1.1 or later)
- **Docker**

To set up your development environment:

1. **Fork the Repository:**  
   Click the "Fork" button on the GitHub page to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork Locally:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nx-ai-plugin.git
   cd nx-ai-plugin
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**  
    Install the Node dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Then, install the Python dependencies using Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

4. **Setup Husky**
    Husky is used to manage Git hooks and ensure code quality before commits. To set it up, run:
    ```bash
    npm rum prepare
    ```

5. **Run the Linter**
    ```bash
    npx nx lint <project>
    ```

6. **Run Affected Projects**

    npx nx affected -t <command>
    ```

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FabioCaffarello/nx-ai-plugin/issues) first to see if it has already been reported. If not, open a new issue with a clear description and steps to reproduce the problem.

## Pull Request Guidelines

We appreciate your contributions! To ensure a smooth review process, please follow these guidelines:

- **Fork the Repository and Create a Branch:**  
  Create a branch off of `main` for your feature or bug fix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
  ```

- **Write Tests:**  
  Ensure that any new functionality is covered by unit and/or e2e tests. Our tests are run using Nx's testing utilities and Jest.

- **Follow the Coding Standards:**  
  Write clean, readable code that adheres to our TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configurations.

- **Update Documentation:**  
  Update the documentation (including this CONTRIBUTING file if necessary) to reflect changes or new features.

- **Submit a Pull Request:**  
  Once your changes are complete and tested, open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch. Include a clear title and description, referencing any related issues.

## Coding Standards

- **Language:**  
  Use TypeScript for plugin development. Follow the style guidelines enforced by ESLint and Prettier.
- **File Organization:**  
  Maintain a clear directory structureâ€”generators in `src/generators/`, executors in `src/executors/`, etc.
- **Comments and Documentation:**  
  Write clear comments and update documentation when you modify functionality.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Write unit tests for any new functionality using Jest and Nx DevKit's testing utilities.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  
  Ensure that your changes integrate correctly in a simulated Nx workspace. Run:
  ```bash
  npx nx e2e nx-ai-plugin-e2e
  ```
- **Continuous Integration:**  
  Our CI pipeline (configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `nx-main.yml`) runs tests and lint checks on every PR.

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) standard. Use the following prefixes for your commit messages:

- **feat:** for new features
- **fix:** for bug fixes
- **docs:** for documentation changes
- **style:** for formatting changes (white-space, etc.)
- **refactor:** for code refactoring without feature changes
- **test:** for adding or updating tests
- **chore:** for changes that don't modify src or test files

Example:
```
feat(agent-generator): add support for upserting new agents
```

## Documentation

- **Site Documentation:**  
  Our documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages: [NX AI Plugin Docs](https://fabiocaffarello.github.io/nx-ai-plugin/).
- **Writing Docs:**  
  When you add new features or change functionality, update the corresponding markdown files in the `docs/` directory. We use MkDocs with the Material theme for a modern, responsive documentation site.
- **Generating API Documentation:**  
  We leverage tools like `mkdocstrings` to generate API references from our TypeScript and Python code. Ensure that any public interfaces are well-documented.
